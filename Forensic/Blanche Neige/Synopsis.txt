We don't know much about this prince, to be honest. Some say he's a dashing hero, while others say he's a bit forgetful.

But one thing's for sure - if anyone can track him down, it's you. So keep your eyes peeled for any clues about this mysterious prince, and together we'll save Blanche Neige and defeat the Evil Queen once and for all!
